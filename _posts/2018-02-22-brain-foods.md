Since I'm preparing for my AIM Master Science in Data Science, I need sustenance to enhance my thinking. The foods considered as "[superfoods](https://www.webmd.com/diet/features/eat-smart-healthier-brain#1)"  are:

* Blueberries
* Salmon
* Nuts and seeds
* Avocados
* Whole grains
* Beans
* Pomegranate juice
* Freshly brewed tea
* Dark chocolate

On the other side, there are [worst foods](http://www.eatthis.com/foods-for-brain/). These are:
* Commercial muffin
* Citrus and diet soda
* Canned tuna
* Soy sauce
* Rib eye steak
* Frozen pie
* Cured meats
* Frozen pizza
* Ice cream
* French fries
* White rice
* Fruit juice
* Alcohol
* Donuts

In other words, I need to stay away from hydrogenated/trans fats, sugar, and sodium to prevent brain drain.
