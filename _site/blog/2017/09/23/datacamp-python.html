      <h1>A Mind For Numbers</h1>

<div class="post">
  <p>I decided to start a miscellaneous reading before I jump into my data science program. It means that I need to finish the material first before I continue with my bridge subjects which are mathematics and programming.</p>

<p>I am enjoying my time reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU">A Mind For Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra)</a>. I find it entertaining at the same time educational. Few books are of this sort. Below are some points which I find worth remembering.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our brain toggles between focused mode and diffuse mode.</li>
  <li>We experience Einstellung effect whenever we feel stuck and fixated in learning a new approach.</li>
  <li>One must know how to shift between focused mode and diffused mode to learn better.</li>
  <li>Pomodoro can be used to beat procrastination.</li>
  <li>Understanding of working memory  and long-term memory is essential.</li>
  <li>Use spaced repetition to build long-term memory.</li>
  <li>Sleep is important.</li>
  <li>It is crucial to find meaning in what you are learning.</li>
  <li>Strengthen and rehearse the important parts of what you are learning and prune away trivialities.</li>
  <li>Steps to build new learning:
    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>Focus your attention.</li>
        <li>Understand the basic idea you are trying to chunk.</li>
        <li>Gain context so you can see just not how, but also when to use this chunk.</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Highlighting or underlining a text may exhibit illusion of competence.</li>
</ul>
