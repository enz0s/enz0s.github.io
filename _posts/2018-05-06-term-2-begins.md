So MSDS Term 1 has ended a week ago and Term 2 begins exactly tomorrow. To recap, the following courses I completed last term are:

- Mathematics for Data Science
- Programming for Data Science
- Introduction to Data Science and Data Privacy
- Data Visualization and Storytelling
- Human Behavior Organization
- Design Thinking

What did I learn from Term 1?

- Learning from others can contribute a lot to your progress.
- I can always improve my learning style by trying other approaches.
- Inspiring teachers can further propel a student's learning immensely.
