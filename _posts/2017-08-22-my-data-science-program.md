I have ultimately come up with my customized data science program. In a quick glance, the outline will be as follows: 

## Bridge
1. Mathematics
	- Principles of Statistics
	- Probability Theory
	- Statistical Analysis of Experimental Data
	- Linear Algebra
	- Matrices and Linear Transformations
	- Calculus
	- Ordinary Differential Equations
	- Partial Differential Equations
	- Numerical Methods
	- Fourier Series
	- Introduction to Information Theory

2. Programming
	- Python (main language)
	- R (intro only)

## Core
1. Intro to Data Science
2. Data Visualization
3. Machine Learning
4. Deep Learning

## Electives
1. Raspberry Pi
2. scikit-learn
3. TensorFlow

## Final Project
* A dev model based on Raspberry Pi and TensorFlow

## Miscellaneous (Readings)
1. Mathematics for the Nonmathematician
2. Mathematics: Its Content, Methods and Meaning
3. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
4. Mathematics and the Physical World
5. Introduction to Linear Algebra and Differential Equations
6. Mathematics and Logic
7. Stanford Mathematics Problem Book
8. Tensor Analysis on Manifolds
9. Tensors, Differential Forms and Variational Principles
10. Lady Luck: The Theory of Probability
11. Elementary Number Theory
12. Prelude to Mathematics
13. A Book of Set Theory
14. Mathematical Modeling Techniques
15. The Divine Proportion
16. Lucifer's Legacy: The Meaning of Assymetry
17. Theoretical Physics
18. Number Theory
19. Geometry
20. Topology
21. Introduction to Graph Theory
22. Star Wars Canon Series (of course!)

I used [David Venturi's program](https://medium.com/@davidventuri/i-dropped-out-of-school-to-create-my-own-data-science-master-s-here-s-my-curriculum-1b400dcee412) and [Maastricht University's curriculum](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/partner-program-master/master-data-science-decision-making) as references to build mine. Also, I'm beginning to fall in love with Dover books. I like how they capture the essential topics.

I will update this post should there be any changes to my preferential value and direction (geeky joke). Fingers crossed that I'll make it too.
