title: "Hacking a Data Science Program"
date: 2017-08-21

My main goal is to learn data science. Initially my plan was to enrol myself in a data science masters program. However, after watching Tetiana Ivanova's speech during the PyData London 2016 I realized that maybe I can pursue a similar path by hacking into self-directed learning. Now I am on my quest on how to hack a data science program.

So far I have gathered related links to my quest. These are:
