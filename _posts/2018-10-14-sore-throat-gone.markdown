So far in my attempt to optimize my time, it has gotten better. It got only fucked up last night when Prince started messaging me. Maybe he felt that I was dissing him and he kind of hinting an apology when he said something about capstone project team. Honestly I didn't know that he had a strategy. Then again who am I to complain if I don't get picked, right? I'm not good in Math. I struggle with it. I should've paid more attention to it in  the past. Maybe I want to blame it Adamson for not giving a better and insightful education. Practical education.

Anyway, my rant isn't about my education though sometimes I wish I went to a better-named school. Hehehe.
