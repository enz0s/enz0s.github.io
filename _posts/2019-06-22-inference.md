Prediction and inference are two main reasons why we would like to estimate function $f$.

*Prediction* is when we determine a possible response $\hat{Y}$ given a predictor $X$ by an estimated function $\hat{f}$. This can be expressed as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:prediction}
\hat{Y} = \hat{f}(X)
\end{equation}

*Inference* is when we want to answer the following questions:

- Which predictors are associated with a response?
- What is the relationship of between the response and each predictor?
- Can the relationship between the response and each predictor be adequately summarized using a linear equation, or is the relationship more complicated?

These questions become fundamentally the basis of making an inference using an estimate $\hat{f}$.
