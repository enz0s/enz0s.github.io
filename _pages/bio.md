Lorenzo has been in the academe for more than 12 years as a Technical Committee Member of the Commission on Higher Education, as a Department Chairperson in Adamson University, and as an Assistant Professor in the field of computer engineering. While digging into research, he stumbled upon data science that stirred his newfound love of data. This led to his decision of leaving the academe in order to jumpstart his career as a data scientist. He belongs to the first batch of graduates of the Master of Science in Data Science from the Asian  Institute of Management, an international business school in Makati that pioneered the first world-class data science laboratory in the country.  His areas of interest include data applications, network science, and geospatial analysis. A university cum laude and high school valedictorian, he believes that learning is a lifelong journey. He likes coffee shops, New Wave songs, and Star Wars.
