title: "Hacking a Data Science Program"
date: 2017-08-21
---
My main goal is to learn data science. Initially my plan was to enrol myself in a data science masters program. However, after watching Tetiana Ivanova's speech during the PyData London 2016 I realized that maybe I can pursue a similar path. Now I am on my quest on how to hack a data science program.

So far I have gathered related links to my quest. Below are related links and outlines that I scoured online. In the end, I designed my own curriculum. This currently serves as my roadmap to data science.
