Lorenzo has been involved in the academe for more than 12 years as a Member of the Technical Committee of the Commission on Higher Education, as Department Chairperson in Adamson University, and as an Assistant Professor in Adamson University. While working on a paper, he stumbled upon data science that stirred his wild curiosity. This led to his decision of leaving academe in order to pursue data science full-time. He belongs to the pioneering batch of the Master of Science in Data Science from the Asian  Institute of Management, the first world-class data science program in the Philippines.  His interests include data applications, network science, and geospatial analysis. A university cum laude and high school valedictorian, he believes that learning may slow down but it should never stop. Also, he likes Star Wars.
