      <h1>Teraflop</h1>
<p class="meta"><em>23 Feb 2018</em></p>

<div class="post">
  <p>Teraflop is a unit of measurement of how fast a computer is according to floating-point calculation. Teraflop is 1 trillion “flops.” Flop stands for “FLOating-Point” calculation. It is said to be that flop is a more accurate measurement than instructions per second. Flop can be described by the number of equations with finite floating-point numbers that a machine can solve in one second.</p>

<p>A traditional calculator can perform 10 flops. Imagine a machine that can perform 10 megaflops. It’s like computing equations with 10 million floating-point numbers in one second. Similarly, a 10-gigaflop machine can compute equations with 10 billion floating-point numbers in one second. We can apply this analogy to other units such as trillion, quadrillion, quintillion, and so on.</p>

<p>AIM’s Analytics, Computing, and Complex Systems lab or ACCeSs@AIM, AIM’s main lab for data science projects, hosts a 500-teraflop computer. This means their machine can compute equations with 500 trillion floating-point numbers in one second. That’s absolutely super fast! Way to go AIM! (Nerding…)</p>
