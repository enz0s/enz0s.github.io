I'm adding DRRM paper to my Pomodoro list. This goal has been stalled for a couple of years and I need to jumpstart its completion.

This paper focuses on developing a nationwide technology framework on automated disaster risk and reduction management system.

I accomplished some preliminary tasks before I engulf myself in DDRM materials. These include:

1. My "dev environment" (Mendeley, MS Word)
2. Skeleton of my manuscript
3. Auto-update table of contents

My suitable literature and studies are:
* international DRRM framework
* current DRRM framework of the Philippines

In addition, I need to:
* Associate the framework to PMP project management
* Associate the framework to PMP business analysis

The outline of my paper is as follows:
1. Current global situation in DRRM
2. Our local situation in DRRM
3. DRRM area of improvement in the Philippines
4. Solution to DRRM area of improvement
