Well I tried to wake up early. Not as early as 4:30 am but 5:00 am is already a big feat for me. I need to push myself further to rise from bed at a much earlier time. Perhaps make it sharp tomorrow? Deal?

I finally found something  to synch my files with. Hopefully this time it can open a simple text file. Meanwhile, my throat hurts and feels itchy. I feel a bit dizzy too. Need to rest or go home early. 

```
lsof -i :4000
kill -9 xxxx
```

What I just typed in was how to kill a process.

Aw. Sad music.

Shall we do the BDCC code?

Go.
