## Functions and linear transformations

### A more formal understanding of functions
<!-- * $f : X \rightarrow Y$
 * $f(x)=x^2$ is mapped as $f : R \rightarrow R$, where the first $R$ is domain and the second $R$ is co-domain. 
 * $f(x)=x^2$ can also represented as $f:x \rightarrow x^2$.
 * Range is the subset of co-domain that the function actually maps to.
 * $g:R^2 \rightarrow R$ is mapped with $R^2$ as domain and $R$ as co-domain. Also, $R$ is the range.
 * $g(x_1, x_2) = 2$ has $x_1, x_2$ as domain, $2$ is co-domain, and $2$ is the range.

Range is the subset of co-domain that the function actually maps to.

\begin{align} \label{a}
f:X \rightarrow Y
\end{align}
The equation \ref{a} implies that $X$ is domain, $Y$ is co-domain, and $Y$ is the range.

\begin{align} \label{f}
f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
\end{align}
The equation \ref{f} implies that $\mathbb{R}$ is domain, $\mathbb{R}$ is co-domain, and $\mathbb{R}$ is the range.

\begin{align} \label{b}
f(x)=x^2
\end{align}
The equation \ref{b} implies that $x$ is domain, $x^2$ is co-domain, and $x^2$ is the range.

\begin{align} \label{g}
f:\mathbb{R^2} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
\end{align}
The equation \ref{g} implies that $\mathbb{R^2}$ is domain, $\mathbb{R}$ is co-domain, and $\mathbb{R}$ is the range.

\begin{align} \label{c}
g(x_1, x_2) = 2
\end{align}
The equation  \ref{c} implies that $x_1, x_2$ is domain, $2$ is co-domain, and $2$ is the range.

\begin{align} \label{d}
h(x_1, x_2) = (x_1 + x_2, x_2 - x_1, x_2x_1)
\end{align}
The equation \ref{d} implies that $(x_1, x_2)$ is domain, $(x_1 + x_2, x_2 - x_1, x_2x_1)$ is co-domain, and $(x_1 + x_2, x_2 - x_1, x_2x_1)$ is the range.

If $x_1 = 2$ and $x_2 = 3$, then
\begin{align} \label{e}
h(2, 3) = (5, 1, 6)
\end{align}
The equation \ref{e} implies that $(2, 3)$ is domain, $(5, 1, 6)$ is co-domain, and $(5, 1, 6)$ is the range.
