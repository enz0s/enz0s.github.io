My notes on [Principles of Statistics (Dover Books on Mathematics)](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Statistics-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486637603/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1503561588&sr=1-1&keywords=statistics+dover):

* Statistical probability and inductive probability are two important features in statistics. Statistical probability, however, is more favorable because it is empirical. This means that the trials are repeatable. Inductive probability is logical. This means that "we are debarred from collecting fresh evidences" because it treats each trial as unique.
