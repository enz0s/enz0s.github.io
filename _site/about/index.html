      <h1>About</h1>

<p>I've been in the university for 10 years and with the government for 5 years. Much of my work is academic. I self-study web technologies through relevant sources such Github, Pluralsight, and uDemy.</p>

<p>I enjoy learning web dev during free time and guinea-pigging my workout and diet regularly. I enjoy listening to The Cure, The Smiths, and their spawns alike. I'm an avid Star Wars fan. </p>

<p>I used to chair a department for 3 years until I decided to step down and pursue my dissertation on web-based mobile app model. And that, my friend, is the reason why I built this site--to chronicle my so-called academic life. Or not.</p>

<p>Welcome and enjoy.</p>
