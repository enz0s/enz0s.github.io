I think much of the stresses in school  stem from unwanted worries. Worries that seem to permeate to other classes too.
I'm not saying that I don't need to  worry. My point is  that worries are not meant thrown carelessly. It is also important to consider how it will affect the receiver on the other end.

Loving how I can drop my thoughts on this post. Only challenge is that I don't to post something directly on my phone. Tried looking for something that allows me to use Android to open Markdown file; however, pCloud seems to lack the feature to detect such file type.

Need to take advantage  of the time that I have. Need to focus. Not be distracted.

Looks cool to blog the task. Feels more techie. Or fancy. I like the sound of the keyboard as my fingers dance on the keys.

Is there a Markdown checklist? Hmm. Anyway, I need to send a reply email to Marikris. I could actually make use of the connection with her.

Felt awesome after replying to Marikris's email. Took me 30 minutes to write up. But hey it's a good letter. I think.

Got to check the tasks again.

Feeling good that I am talking to myself with nothing much to say. Haha. Lazy. At least this keeps me company. I badly need to shake off the feeling that I need to use apps to keep me company. I don't noise in my life. Hence, the need to talk to myself.

Blah blah blah.

So I  saw Jed. Perhaps he plans to do Crossfit. He has that plastic bag again. As if he's dragging his clothes in plastic bag. I wonder what Trissa is doing. Focus focus focus. Hello hello hello.

According to the reading, you have 2 -first: breadth and depth.

And frequent itemset satistifies the minsum. Cool.
