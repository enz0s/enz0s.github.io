## Probability with counting outcomes

Problem: Find the probability of flipping exactly two heads on three coins.

Answer: 

\begin{align} \label{1}
	P(\textrm{exactly two heads}) = \frac{3}{8}
\end{align}

The equation \ref{1} shows the probability of flipping exactly two heads.


## Example: All the ways you can flip a coin

Problem: Find the probability of getting exactly two heads when flipping three coins.

Answer: 

\begin{align} \label{2}
	P(\textrm{exactly two heads}) = \frac{3}{8}
\end{align}
