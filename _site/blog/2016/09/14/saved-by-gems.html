  <p>I’ve been Jekyll-ed. Yes, I am.</p>

<p>I used to be a Wordpress fan until spams and food-like comments bombarded my site.</p>

<p>One day, when I was cruising on something new to learn, I stumbled upon Jekyll, a static generator. I had no idea what it meant at that time. This prompted me to study it, leading me to realize that this interesting web magic can help me with my current site issue.</p>

<p>It took me awhile to get used to it. It was not entirely a breeze. I needed to do some steps before I get to see what Jekyll is all about. I updated my Mac, downloaded gems (such a fancy term to use), and run some scripts.</p>

<p>I was all set. Excited, in fact. I was about to launch “jekyll serve” to see the results. Then, boom. It didn’t work.</p>

<p>I retraced my steps. I even re-installed all gems. Still, it didn’t work. I searched online any related problem that was causing my failed attempt. I found out that Jekyll had an issue with the latest Mac OS. Argh.</p>

<p>I re-worked my steps. I downloaded tools to make my web dream a reality. I placed my hope on rbenv, a gem that would ultimately resolve my issue. It did and it was amazing.</p>

<p>I typed “jekyll serve” and yes, I made it. I was so relieved. Extremely joyous. Finally I made Jekyll work.</p>

<p>Such an awesome feeling.</p>
