The handout is correct: I learned how to use conda in less than 30 minutes. Initially I thought that it is another gruesome code crunching task. It turned out quite practical and easy. Some useful commands that I use are:

```
/* Create a new environment */
conda create --name some-env
```

```
/* Use environment */
source activate some-env
```

```
/* Close current environment */
source deactivate
```

```
/* Check what are installed in current environment */
conda info --envs
```

```
/* Install jupyter in current environment */
conda install jupyter
```

```
/* Run jupyter in current environment */
jupyter-notebook
```

```
/* Check installed packages in current environment */
conda list
```

```
/* Check installed packages in current environment */
conda list
```

```
/* Check installed packages in current environment */
conda install some_package
```
