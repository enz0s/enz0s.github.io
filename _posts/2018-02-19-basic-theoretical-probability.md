These notes are taken from [Khan Academy's Probability: Basic Theoretical Probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library/basic-theoretical-probability/v/basic-probability).

## Intro to theoretical probability

\begin{align} \label{1}
	P(H) = \frac{1}{2} = 50%
\end{align}

The equation \ref{1} shows the probability of flipping heads of a coin.

\begin{align} \label{2}
	P(1) = \frac{1}{6}
\end{align}

The equation \ref{2} shows the probability of getting 1 after rolling a die.

\begin{align} \label{3}
	P(1 \textrm{ or } 6) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\end{align}

The equation \ref{3} shows the probability of getting 1 or 6 after rolling a die.

\begin{align} \label{4}
	P(2 \textrm{ and }  3) = \frac{0}{6}
\end{align}

The equation \ref{4} shows the probability of getting 2 and 3 after rolling a die.

\begin{align} \label{5}
	P( \textrm{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\end{align}

The equation \ref{5} shows the probability of getting an even number such as 2, 4, or 6 after rolling a die.
