In addition to hacking my data science program, I need to brush up my Markdown basics. I've been coding my site in Markdown instead of HTML. The latter should have outwon me due to familiarity; however, I've seen the former's simplicity as a major advantage.

I haven't use all Markdown syntax over the course of this site but I will list the ones that I frequently use. So far, these are:

```markdown
/* link */
(description)[url]
```

```markdown
/* h2 (just like in html; h1 or first level is taken by the blog post title) */
## second-level heading 
```

```markdown
/* h3 (which is a subheading of h2) */
### third-level heading
```

```markdown
/* h4 (which is a subheading of h3) */
#### fourth-level heading
```

```markdown
/* unordered bullet */
* this item
* another item
* and so on
```

```markdown
/* ordered bullet */
1. first item
2. second item
3. and so on
```

```markdown
/* syntax highlighting (just like this post) */
```code line 1
```code line 2
```

The [Markdown Style Guide](http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/) has been a powerful source to me. Plus I get to use the same syntax to add notes and comments in Jupyter notebook. As they say, KISS.
