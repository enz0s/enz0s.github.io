It's fascinating how simple steps can go a long way. "IDEA" is a mnemonic device to remember the steps to solve a math problem. These are:


* Identify the Problem
    - Read the problem
    - Paraphrase the problem
    - Underline/circle important information
* Develop a Solution: Strategy
    - Draw a picture or diagram
    - Make a plan to solve the problem
* Evaluate: Solve!
    - Show all of your work
    - Use words, numbers, and/or pictures
* Assess Your Answer: Check
    - Read the problem again
    - Make sure you understand the question
    - Check for mathematical errors

These steps are taken from [4 Steps to Math Problem Solving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk0Q37GDmJ8) by Sabrina Knopf.
