      <h1>Notes on A Mind For Numbers</h1>
<p class="meta"><em>24 Aug 2017</em></p>

<div class="post">
  <p>I decided to start a miscellaneous reading before I jump into my data science program. It means that I need to finish the material first before I continue with my bridge subjects which are mathematics and programming.</p>

<p>I am enjoying my time reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU">A Mind For Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra)</a>. I find it entertaining at the same time educational. Few books are of this sort.</p>

<p>Easy Does It</p>
<ul>
  <li>Our brain toggles between focused mode and diffuse mode.</li>
  <li>We experience Einstellung effect whenever we feel stuck and fixated in learning a new approach.</li>
</ul>

<p>Learning is Creating</p>
<ul>
  <li>One must know how to shift between focused mode and diffused mode to learn better.</li>
  <li>Pomodoro can be used to beat procrastination.</li>
  <li>Understanding of working memory  and long-term memory is essential.</li>
  <li>Use Spaced repetition to build long-term memory.</li>
  <li>Sleep is important.</li>
  <li>It is crucial to find meaning in what you are learning.</li>
  <li>Strengthen and rehearse the important parts of what you are learning and prune away trivialities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chunking and Avoiding Illusions of Competence</p>
<ol>
  <li>Focus your attention.</li>
  <li>Understand the basic idea you are trying to chunk.</li>
  <li>Gain context so you can see just not how, but also when to use this chunk.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Highlighting or underlining a text gives an illusion of competence. Use this technique after understanding the passage. Highlight only keywords or phrases.</li>
</ul>
