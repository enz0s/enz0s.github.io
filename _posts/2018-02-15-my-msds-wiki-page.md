Hello! I'm Lorenzo Sta. Maria. My work is mainly organizational and academic but it has never stopped me to pursue lifelong learning. My journey has led me to the growing and enchanting world of data science. I am super excited to jumpstart my life through AIM MSDS program and the powerhouse faculty lineup that supports it. I would like to see myself in the future as a home-grown Filipino *data science unicorn* who generates business value and champions the advocacy of the socially-disadvantaged through data-driven solutions.

## What are your main interests?
My current work defines my main interests. As a Technical Committee Member in the Commission on Higher Education \(CHED\), I advocate outcomes-based education \(OBE\) by designing curricula that directly address industry needs. As an Assistant Professor in Adamson University, I apply OBE processes to improve the educational experience of my students. As a former National President of the Institute of Computer Engineers in the Philippines \(ICpEP\), I applied a similar goal-oriented approach to attain the organization's three-year strategic objectives.


On the side, I practice mind-body connection in the gym and minimalism in my way of life. I am a Star Wars fan. I firmly believe that it upholds one great philosophy in life: there is balance in the *Force* and it binds us all.

## What sort of expertise can you bring to the cohort?

Admittedly, my current work is not directly related to data science. However, I believe that my transferable skills will allow me to adjust organically to the demand of work. 

I can synthesize principles and concepts to uncover connections among and between them, analyze situations and present alternative actions, and compile information by devising a systematic approach.

I can mentor individuals and adjust to their personalities, instruct people by crafting inventive ways such as analogy and story-telling, and serve or assist the needs and requests of individuals with attention to detail.

I can set up a dev environment, work on a solution using mobile and web technologies, and control and debug a solution.

## What do you hope to get out of the M.S. in Data Science program?

Unicorns do not exist but with AIM MSDS program, I believe it can. My ultimate goal of becoming a home-grown Filipino *data science unicorn* will be a reality through the guidance of our teachers and mentors. I hope to develop the characteristics that are expected from one: math-savvy, technology-adept, and domain-proficient. 

## What do you hope to get out of studying at the Asian Inst. of Management?

In addition to gaining the necessary skill set, I hope to embody the dynamism the institution is known for. I hope to become an AIM alumnus who can lead, inspire and  transform the nation through data-driven solutions.

## Do you have any possible data-driven projects in mind?

Aside from generating business value in the industry, I would like to empower the socially-disadvantaged through data science. I hope to come up with solutions that  can improve social and economic conditions across all strata. I hope to build a data-driven traffic management system to ease the traffic in Metro Manila, a data-driven HIV decision-making system to provide better support programs, and a data-driven mental healthcare system to provide better treatments.
