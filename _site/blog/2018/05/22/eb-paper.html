      <h1>Critical success factors of IT-BPO</h1>
<p class="meta"><em>22 May 2018</em></p>

<div class="post">
  <p>The success of the IT-BPO sector can be attributed to the key factors at the macro-level perspective. These are technology, population growth, and human capital. The paper enumerates studies and literature to support this claim.</p>

<p><img src="/image/eb-image5.png" alt="Critical success factors" /></p>

<p>Pasag (2017) identified government initiatives and policies that propelled technology in the country. The Ramos administration rolled several of them: the National Information Plan 2000 (1991), the National Information Technology Council (1994), and the Government Agencies’ Internet Connectivity Directives (1997). The Estrada administration enacted the Electronic Commerce Act (2000) and the Government Information Systems Plan (2000). The Arroyo administration prioritized ICT through the General Appropriations Act of 2004-2010. The Aquino administration signed the bill for the Department of Information and Communications Technology or DICT (2016). The Duterte administration rolled out the National Broadband Plan (2017) and supported foreign telcos to provide faster Internet services.</p>

<p>Furuoka (2010) stated that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship between  economic performance and population growth in the Philippines. This means that the improving economy has a positive impact to Philippine population. The figure above shows that the population increases over time. The Philippines grew massively from 63 M in  1991 to 104 B in 2017.</p>

<p>Price, Francisco, and Caboverde (2016) highlighted the significance of human capital in the IT-BPO sector. Similarly, Del Prado (2015) mentioned that human capital investment is necessary to push the sector further. The figure above shows the number of college graduates over time. The number of college graduates  rose from 312,667 in 1994 to 645,973 in 2016. The increase may not be dramatic but these graduates are important part of the human capital as some of them became part of the IT-BPO sector.</p>

<p>In addition to these success factors, there are other factors that contributed to rise of IT-BPO sector. Sachitanand (2010) reported that the Philippines make a “snug fit” to the United States in terms of cultural similarities. Nejar, Rempillo, and Seraspi (2012) highlighted that the Philippines offered a “generous” tax incentives to BPO companies, comparable to other countries such as India, China, South Africa, and Jamaica. Sachitanand (2010) added also that the Philippines produces English-proficient college graduates. New York Times further supported this when they said that the Philippines is “the new capital of call centers” (Bajaj, 2011).</p>
