So I think if I don't rely on the app, I procrastinate less. 

I think my agitation stems from the constant need to feel connected even though I know I can be connected to my actual friends.

I need to stay calm.

Thirty minutes have passed and I barely started my study. 

Focus. Focus. Focus. 

I feel a little lost right now. Is it because I feel lacking? Or worried? I worry about my HBS. I need to take that exam next week. I know I need to study hard but I feel like I failed already. 

For now, I feel less distracted because I get to blog what I want to say. Switch to phone when there's a need for me to say what I feel.

Maybe this is what I need. A vehicle to say what I feel. All those worries. Fears. Insecurities. 

I need to shake them off. I might need help this time.

There is always that some sort of distraction I get from checking out people. Not good. Need to focus on the most important matter on the table. 

GBV: So its seems that financial accounting is a bit challenging due to large number of terms to be remembered. Need to find the 80/20 of this course.

GBV: Land does not depreciate. Franchise fee is considered a long-term intangible asset. 

GBV: I learned that gross margin as percentage of sales is gross margin over sales times 100.

GBV: As it flows, debits goes first then followed by credit. Cash can appear as credit. You can gave multiple debit or multiple credit. Just be sure that the values match (matching principle).

Sooo. I'm pretending to talk to someone. That person I want to talk to. Someone like me  Haha.

Feeling silly right now because I'm doing this and no one knows that I'm doing this. Really silly I know.

I think I don't need the app. If I need to chat, I'll blog. I think that makes sense  Less assuming. Less expectations. 

Home. Surprisingly early. Rest a little then sleep. I need need need to change my bad habits.
