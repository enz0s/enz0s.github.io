I think my heart and mind are not in sync. That's exactly how I feel. Something that tells me that I've been wasting my time over apps that do not contribute much to my personal life. Just noise that add nothing.

Been going back to the same apps over the past months. I think it has done something bad to me. My attention has declined. I seem to get distracted by messages right away even when I know that I have deadlines to finish. 

I guess I have reached my tipping point. Thanks to ru, the guy who seem to genuinely like me, for making me realize that I've been  dependent of people's attention to me. Even at some point I feel like I don't like getting the attention. But deep inside, I do.

I think and I believe that what's keeping me back to those apps is the need to get connected. Someone to talk to. Someone like myself. My doppelganger. In the quest of searching, I lost myself. 

I need to regain bring everything back to myself.

I need to take the awesomeness to myself again. I think I am lonely, which mainly the reason why I'm being pulled back to the apps. 

I need to say goodbye.
