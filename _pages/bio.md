Lorenzo has been involved in the academe for more than 12 years as a Member of the Technical Committee of the Commission on Higher Education, as a Department Chairperson in Adamson University, and as an Assistant Professor in the field of computer engineering. While digging into research, he stumbled upon data science that stirred his newfound passion for a multi-faceted discipline. This led to his decision of leaving academe in order to study data science full-time. He now belongs to the pioneering batch of the Master of Science in Data Science from the Asian  Institute of Management, an international business school in Makati that provides the first world-class data science program in the Philippines.  His areas of interest include data applications, network science, and geospatial analysis. A university cum laude and high school valedictorian, he believes that learning may slow down but it should never stop. Also, he likes coffee, New Wave songs, and Star Wars.
