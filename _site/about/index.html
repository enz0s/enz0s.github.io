      <h1>About</h1>

<p>I've been working in the university for 10 years and providing consultancy for 5 years. Much of my work is highly academic. I self-study web technologies through relevant sources such Github and Pluralsight.</p>

<p>I enjoy learning web dev during free time and guinea-pigging my workout and diet regularly. I enjoy listening to The Cure, The Smiths, and their spawns alike. I'm an avid Star Wars fan. </p>

<p>I used to chair a department for 3 years until I decided to step down and pursue my dissertation on designing a model of technology implementation plan. And that, my friend, is the reason why I built this site--to chronicle my so-called academic life. Or not.</p>

<p>Welcome and enjoy.</p>
