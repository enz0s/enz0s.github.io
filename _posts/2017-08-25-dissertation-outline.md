I'm adding dissertation to my pomodoro list. This goal has been stalled for a couple of years and I need to jumpstart its completion.

My dissertation focuses on developing a nationwide technology framework on automated disaster risk and reduction management system.

To accomplish this, I need to find suitable literature and studies on:
* international DRRM framework
* current DRRM framework of the Philippines


In addition, I need to:
* Associate the framework to PMP project management
* Associate the framework to PMP business analysis
