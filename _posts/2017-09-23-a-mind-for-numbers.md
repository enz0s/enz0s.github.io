I decided to start a miscellaneous reading before I jump into my data science program. It means that I need to finish the material first before I continue with my bridge subjects which are mathematics and programming.

I am enjoying my time reading [A Mind For Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra)](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU). I find it entertaining at the same time educational. Few books are of this sort. Below are some points which I find worth remembering.

1. If you don't like numbers or science, you can still change your mind.
2. One must know how to shift between focused mode and diffused mode to learn better. Beat Einstellung effect.
3. Spaced repetition builds from working memory to long-term memory. Find meaning. Strengthen and rehearse. Prune away trivialities. Sleep.
4. Create conceptual chunks by:
> 1. Focus your attention.
> 2. Understand the basic idea.
> 3. Practice to gain big-picture context.
5.  Procrastination is a poison with long-term effects.
6. Build habits by:
> 1. Cue
> 2. Routine
> 3. Reward
> 4. Belief
7. Law of Serendipity follows Lady Luck.
8. Eat your frogs first!
9. Keep a planner-journal to easily track your goals and observe what does and doesn't work.
10. Memory palace technique strengthens visual memory system.
11. Stories are silly memory tricks that build retention.
