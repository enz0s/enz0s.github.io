I decided to start a miscellaneous reading before I jump into my data science program. It means that I need to finish the material first before I continue with my bridge subjects which are mathematics and programming.

I am enjoying my time reading [A Mind For Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra)](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU). I find it entertaining at the same time educational. Few books are of this sort. 

Easy Does It
* Our brain toggles between focused mode and diffuse mode.
* We experience Einstellung effect whenever we feel stuck and fixated in learning a new approach.

Learning is Creating
* One must know how to shift between focused mode and diffused mode to learn better.
* Pomodoro can be used to beat procrastination.
* Understanding of working memory  and long-term memory is essential.
* Use Spaced repetition to build long-term memory.
* Sleep is important.
* It is crucial to find meaning in what you are learning.
* Strengthen and rehearse the important parts of what you are learning and prune away trivialities.

Chunking and Avoiding Illusions of Competence
1. Focus your attention.
2. Understand the basic idea you are trying to chunk.
3. Gain context so you can see just not how, but also when to use this chunk.

* Highlighting or underlining a text gives an illusion of competence. Use this technique after understanding the passage. Highlight only keywords or phrases.
